Project Description:
Play Trivia by login in or creating an account.
You can log out by clicking the log out button.
Then select you options for the game: the category, difficulty, question type, and how many questions.
Then press start.
You will have fifteen seconds to answer before your answer is marked as wrong and you are moved to the next question.
